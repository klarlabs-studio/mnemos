This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What is Mnemos?

Mnemos is a local-first evidence layer that grounds AI in truth. It extracts structured claims from text, detects contradictions between claims, and returns query answers with full evidence traceability.

Pipeline: `ingest → extract → relate → query`

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
make check          # fmt + lint + test + build (NOT -race; see make test-race)
make build          # Build bin/mnemos
make install        # Install mnemos to $GOPATH/bin
make test           # Run all tests (includes 133 eval cases across 13 suites under data/eval/*.yaml)
make test-race      # What CI actually runs (-race). `make check` omits it, so green locally != green in CI.
make brain-eval     # Cognitive-process A/B harness — does consolidation IMPROVE the brain? (see below)
make fmt            # go fmt ./...
make lint           # go vet + golangci-lint
make sqlc           # Regenerate sqlc query code from sql/sqlite/
make release-check  # Validate .goreleaser.yaml
```

Run a single test:
```bash
go test -run TestName ./internal/extract/
go test -race -count=1 ./internal/store/sqlite/
```

## Architecture

### Ports & Adapters

Core interfaces live in `internal/ports/interfaces.go`. All repository methods accept `context.Context` as the first parameter for timeout/cancellation propagation:
- `EventRepository`, `ClaimRepository`, `RelationshipRepository`, `EmbeddingRepository` — storage ports
- `ExtractionEngine` — extract claims from events
- `QueryEngine` — answer questions with evidence

All implementations are behind these interfaces, enabling clean testing and provider swapping.

### Domain Model (`internal/domain/`)

- **Event** — immutable, append-only knowledge unit (tagged with `run_id` for isolation)
- **Claim** — derived assertion with type (fact/hypothesis/decision), confidence (0–1), status (active/contested/deprecated), per-claim `LastVerified` / `VerifyCount` / `HalfLifeDays`, optional `Scope{Service, Env, Team}`
- **ClaimEvidence** — links claims to source events (≥1 per claim)
- **Relationship** — claim-to-claim edge: `supports`, `contradicts`, plus the causal+outcome family from Phase 1 (`causes`, `caused_by`, `action_of`, `outcome_of`, `validates`, `refutes`, `derived_from`)
- **EmbeddingRecord** — stored vector embedding with metadata
- **Action** — recorded operational change (kind, subject, actor, at, run_id, metadata)
- **Outcome** — observed result of an Action (action_id, result, metrics map, source push|pull:*)
- **Lesson** — synthesised operational truth (statement, scope, evidence []ActionID, confidence, trigger, kind, source synthesize|human)
- **Decision** — agent decision audit record (statement, plan, reasoning, risk_level, beliefs []ClaimID, alternatives, outcome_id)
- **Playbook** — Agent-ready response (trigger, scope, steps []PlaybookStep, derived_from_lessons, confidence). Consumers run them through whatever execution layer they own.
- **Scope** — multi-tenant filter primitive: {Service, Env, Team} (LessonScope is an alias kept for back-compat)
- **Answer** — query result bundling claims, contradictions, timeline, hop distances, claim provenance, and `StaleClaimIDs`

All domain types have `Validate()` methods.

**Vocabulary is frozen during consolidation.** Machine terms (Claim/Event/Relationship/Lesson/Playbook) and brain terms (Belief/Episode/Association/Schema/Reflex) each own specific surfaces. The wire is brain-native, while the root Go API, storage and config use machine terms. `internal/domain` declares the brain names, but call sites use the machine aliases. Do not rename in either direction. See [docs/vocabulary.md](docs/vocabulary.md). Contradictions are first-class concepts, not afterthoughts.

### Package Responsibilities

This table covers the **ingest→extract→relate→query pipeline**. It is not the
whole of `internal/` — the cognitive and governance layers below have their own
entries, and `ls internal/` is the authoritative list. Treat a package's own
`// Package …` doc comment as the source of truth; this table is a map, not an
inventory.

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| `internal/ingest/` | Multi-format input → events |
| `internal/parser/` | Input normalization |
| `internal/extract/` | Rule-based and LLM-powered claim extraction |
| `internal/relate/` | Pairwise relationship detection with stop-word filtering and overlap thresholds; `DetectCausal` heuristic + `DetectCausalLLM` LLM augmentation for borderline pairs |
| `internal/query/` | Question answering with ranking (embeddings or token overlap fallback); scope filter; stale-claim surfacing |
| `internal/embedding/` | Vector embedding client abstraction (openai, gemini, ollama, openai-compat) |
| `internal/llm/` | LLM client abstraction (anthropic, openai, gemini, ollama, openai-compat) |
| `internal/store/sqlite/` | SQLite repositories with foreign key enforcement; sqlc-generated queries in `sqlcgen/` |
| `internal/pipeline/` | Shared orchestration: `Extractor`, `PersistArtifacts`, `GenerateEmbeddings`, `GenerateClaimEmbeddings` (used by both CLI and MCP) |
| `internal/workflow/` | Job runner with statekit state machine, retry, and timeout |
| `internal/synthesize/` | Cluster action→outcome chains into Lessons; cluster Lessons by trigger into Playbooks |
| `internal/markdown/` | Round-trip Lessons + Playbooks to YAML-frontmatter markdown for the human-editable layer |
| `internal/adapters/outcomes/` | Pull-based Outcome sources; first impl: Prometheus instant-query adapter |

The cognitive, trust and governance layers — absent from every earlier version of
this file, which made them invisible to anyone navigating by it:

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| `internal/trust/` | Derives the single comparable `trust_score` per belief |
| `internal/credit/` | Credit assignment: the outcome→belief-trust loop |
| `internal/salience/` | Unified salience / stakes dimension (ADR 0013) |
| `internal/plasticity/` | Global neuromodulatory gain (ADR 0015 §2) |
| `internal/consolidate/` | Systems consolidation (ADR 0011 Phase B) |
| `internal/curiosity/` | Turns passive metacognition (knowledge gaps) into active questions |
| `internal/bias/` | Explainable bias indicators over the belief set |
| `internal/brainbench/` | Paired A/B harness measuring whether the cognitive processes *improve* a brain (`make brain-eval`) |
| `internal/autoedge/` | Wires the implicit relationships that fall out of writes |
| `internal/kernel/` | axi-go governance layer for the library core |
| `internal/govwrite/` | The governed daemon-write surface — every durable write goes through it |
| `internal/auth/` | Identity primitives: JWT issuance and verification |
| `internal/runscope/` | Run-scoped token boundary (F.4.b) |

### Entrypoints

- `cmd/mnemos/` — CLI. The subcommands below are the ones with behaviour worth
  explaining, **not the full set** — `mnemos --help` and the dispatch switch in
  `cmd/mnemos/main.go` are authoritative. Commands including `action`,
  `consolidate`, `curiosity` and `classify-durability` exist without appearing
  here. Subcommands:
  - Setup: `init` (system-detecting one-command bootstrap: brain + config + MCP registration + Claude Code hooks + skills; `--project`, `--dry-run`, `--yes`, `--no-hooks`, `--no-skills`, `--hooks`, `--no-mcp`, `--db <dsn>`, `--force`; `--url <endpoint> [--token]` registers a remote HTTP MCP server for a hosted brain **and** installs recall/brief/capture hooks that call the hosted brain over REST (writing the URL/token to the 0600 config, never inlined into Claude settings); `--service [--out]` scaffolds a `mnemos serve` deployment bundle via `scaffoldService`), `setup` (minimal MCP-only registration), `hook <recall|brief|capture>` (internal Claude Code hook handlers, read event JSON on stdin, fail-open). **Hosted vs local hooks:** when `MNEMOS_URL` is set (hosted, via the `server:` config block → `MNEMOS_URL`/`MNEMOS_TOKEN`), the hooks route through the `client` package to REST — recall→`GET /v1/search`, brief→`GET /v1/metrics`, capture→`POST /v1/process` — with a bearer token; otherwise they open the local store (`hostedConfigured()`/`hostedClient()` in `hook.go`). `/v1/process` (`makeProcessHandler`) is the REST analogue of the `process_text` MCP tool — it runs the full ingest→extract→relate pipeline server-side; `use_llm`/`use_embeddings` are tri-state (`*bool`), so an omitting hook lets the server default to its own LLM config instead of hard-failing. `init --db` accepts any store DSN (sqlite/postgres/mysql/libsql); it opens the DSN first (connectivity check + schema bootstrap) and fails fast if unreachable (unless `--force`). Credential hygiene: a credential-free DSN (local SQLite/memory) is inlined into Claude's config; a networked DSN with a password is written to the 0600 config file (via `config.SetValues`) and discovered by the server/hooks, never inlined into `~/.claude.json`/`settings.json`. Setup logic lives in `init.go`/`setup.go`/`detect.go`/`hooks_install.go`/`skills_install.go`; the same plan/apply engine backs the `configure_environment` MCP tool.
  - **Skills (manual brief/capture).** `init` also installs two Claude Code skills into `<.claude>/skills/` — `/mnemos-brief` and `/mnemos-capture` — the on-demand counterparts to the `SessionStart` brief and `SessionEnd` capture hooks. They are markdown embedded in the binary (`cmd/mnemos/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `//go:embed`) and installed by `installSkills` in `skills_install.go`: idempotent (identical content is a no-op), backing up any divergent prior version as `.bak-mnemos`, mirroring `installHooks`. The names are `mnemos-`-prefixed deliberately — bare `brief`/`capture` collide with the Agent OS memory skills. Skills carry no DSN and no token (they instruct the agent to use the MCP tools, CLI only as fallback), so they install identically in local and hosted mode and are independent of `--no-hooks`. Opt out with `--no-skills` (`noSkills` on `configure_environment`). Adding a skill directory requires registering it in `skillNames`, enforced by `TestSkills_EmbeddedMatchesRegistered`.
  - Core: `ingest`, `extract` (supports `--run`), `relate`, `process`, `query`, `metrics`, `verify`
  - Phase 2: `action record/list`, `outcome record/list`
  - Phase 3: `synthesize`, `lessons [--service|--trigger]`
  - Phase 5: `decision record/list/show/attach-outcome`
  - Phase 6: `playbook synthesize/list/show/<trigger>`
  - Phase 7: `export --kind=lesson|playbook`, `import <file.md>`, `history --kind=lesson|playbook`
- `mnemos mcp` — MCP server. **`mcpToolScopes` in `cmd/mnemos/mcp_scopes.go` is the authoritative tool list** (~53 tools, and a test makes an unclassified new tool a build failure). Do not treat any list in this file as complete: earlier revisions named 18 and read as exhaustive, so two dozen shipped tools — `remember`, `search_memory`, `who_knows`, `recall_at_time`, `memory_context`, `knowledge_gaps`, `record_feedback`, `record_observation`, `signals`, `calibration`, `classify` and others — were invisible to anyone navigating by this document.

  The pipeline-facing subset, for orientation only: `query_knowledge`, `process_text`, `knowledge_metrics`, `configure_environment`, `record_action`, `record_outcome`, `synthesize_schemas`, `query_schemas`, `record_decision`, `query_decisions`, `query_reflex`, `synthesize_reflexes`, `list_beliefs`, `list_decisions`, `list_dissonances`, `watch_file`, `ingest_git_log`, `ingest_git_prs`. These are the brain-native names since v0.85.0 — `list_claims`, `query_lessons`, `synthesize_lessons`, `query_playbook` and `synthesize_playbooks` no longer exist. Default transport is stdio (local Claude Code). `mnemos mcp --http <addr> [--auth|--no-auth]` serves the identical tool set over Streamable HTTP so remote MCP clients can reach a hosted brain — `--auth` (default for `--http`) gates every request behind a bearer JWT via the mcp-go `transport.WithAuthorize` hook (`serveMCPHTTP` in `cmd/mnemos/mcp_http.go`, reusing the same `auth.Verifier` as `serve`'s gRPC); TLS from `MNEMOS_TLS_*`. Per-request identity: `transport.WithRequestContextFn` stashes the validated `*auth.Claims` in each request's context (`mcp_identity.go`); write handlers attribute `created_by` to the token subject via `mcpActorFor(ctx, fallback)` (through both the direct and axi-kernel executor paths), and run-scoped reads enforce the token's run allowlist via `mcpRunAllowed`. Stdio has no claims, so both fall back to the process actor / no restriction — unchanged. **Per-tool scopes (`mcp_scopes.go`):** every `tools/call` is gated on the token's `scp` claim by `mcpScopeMiddleware`, a single middleware in `mcpMiddlewareStack` — REST gates writes with `requireScope` and gRPC with its interceptor, but MCP authenticated without ever reading `scp`, so a token minted `--scope claims:read` was refused `POST /v1/beliefs` and then allowed to call `process_text`, `remember`, `forget` and every other write tool. `mcpToolScopes` maps each tool to its required scope (reads `""`; writes `claims:write`/`events:write`; `memory_promote` → `promote:global`; `configure_environment` → `*`, since over HTTP it writes the *server's* filesystem). Unmapped tools fail closed to `*`. `TestMCPToolScopes_CoversEveryRegisteredTool` (against the live `srv.Tool` list) and `TestMCPToolScopes_AgreeWithKernelEffects` (against the axi-kernel read/write effects) make an unclassified new tool a build failure; `TestMCPMiddlewareStack_EnforcesScopes` pins the wiring, not just the guard. Stdio carries no claims and is unaffected.

**Multi-tenant per server (ADR 0007, Phase 1):** `mcp --http --require-tenant` serves many tenants from one process. The JWT carries a `tnt` claim (`Claims.Tenant`; mint with `token issue --tenant` / `agent token issue --tenant`). In this mode the auth hook **denies** a token without a valid tenant (fail-closed), `withTenant` stashes the effective tenant, and `resolveDSNForContext` scopes the request per backend; the cognitive path routes through a per-tenant `memFacade.Tenant()` cache. **Two isolation models (`internal/store.TenancyModeForDSN`):** Postgres uses **row-level** isolation — `resolveDSNForContext` appends `?tenant=<id>`, the provider pins the `mnemos.tenant` GUC, and RLS isolates the request (needs a non-superuser role — superusers bypass RLS). sqlite / mysql / **local** libSQL use **namespace-per-tenant** physical isolation — `resolveDSNForContext` sets `?namespace=<derived>` where the derived namespace is `store.TenantNamespace(tenant)` (a `t_`-prefixed, hash-suffixed, charset-safe mapping since the tenant charset is broader than the namespace charset), and the provider partitions into a separate schema/database/file created on first open. Backends that cannot isolate — `memory://` and **remote** libSQL (it discards `namespace`) — report `TenancyNone` and `--require-tenant` refuses to start (fail-closed). The reserved default namespace `mnemos` is the namespace-model analogue of the reserved `__default__` tenant: a derived tenant namespace can never equal it. Guardrails: `TestSQLite_CrossTenantIsolation`, `TestLibsql_LocalCrossTenantIsolation`, `TestMySQL_CrossTenantIsolation`, `TestGRPC_CrossTenantIsolation_SQLite`, `TestTenant_SQLiteNamespaceIsolation`, plus the Postgres RLS suite. **Connection reuse:** the MCP server caches one read pool per tenant-scoped DSN (`enableConnCache` in `dsn.go`; keyed by the resolved DSN incl. `?tenant=`, so tenants never share a pool and RLS is unchanged) — reads reuse a pooled conn instead of opening one per request. Writes (`openWriter`) stay per-request. **Phase 2 (opt-in, `MNEMOS_PG_SHARED_POOL`/`db.shared_pool`):** one shared Postgres pool serves all tenants — a per-request `*sql.Conn` is checked out, pinned with `SET mnemos.tenant`, and its Closer runs `RESET mnemos.tenant` before releasing it (fail-closed if ever reused unset). Repos take a `pgQuerier` interface (`*sql.DB` for the default per-tenant-pool path, `*sql.Conn` for shared); `openSharedTenantConn`/`getSharedPool` in `internal/store/postgres/postgres.go`. The cmd conn-cache is disabled in this mode (it would pin one conn per tenant). Default stays the per-tenant-pool model. Verified by `TestPostgres_CrossTenantIsolation` (both modes, skips on an RLS-bypassing role) — the ADR-0007 guardrail — plus an MCP e2e showing 30 mixed-tenant requests share ~2 connections.
- `mnemos serve [--grpc-port N]` — REST + gRPC API service (the "as a service" surface; JWT auth, TLS/mTLS, multi-tenant namespace/RLS). `serve --require-tenant` (ADR 0007) makes every REST **and** gRPC request scope to its token's `tnt` claim via a per-request tenant connection (Postgres RLS or namespace-per-tenant for sqlite/mysql/local libSQL — see the MCP note above): REST auths reads too and a `tenantScopeMiddleware` opens the tenant conn (handlers resolve it through `scopedConn/scopedWriter/scopedMem` in `serve_tenant.go`); gRPC's interceptor opens it and methods resolve via `connFor/writerFor/memFor` (`internal/server/grpc`). Secure by default (v0.85.1+): every data endpoint requires a JWT (reads too); only bare-liveness/static infra endpoints (`/health`, `/healthz`, `/`, `/app`) stay unauthenticated. `/internal/metrics` is **authenticated by default** (opt out with `serve --metrics-public`; it is excluded from the `--public-reads` bypass) and the version/DB-probe report lives behind auth at `/internal/ready`. Anonymous reads are an explicit opt-in (`serve --public-reads`); `mcp --http` defaults to `--auth`. Guarded by `TestREST_ReadsRequireAuthByDefault`, `TestAuthenticate_ReadsRequireTokenByDefault`, `TestPostgres_CrossTenantIsolation`, `TestGRPC_CrossTenantIsolation`, and `TestGRPC_CrossTenantIsolation_SQLite`. Distinct from the MCP surface; API parity across MCP/HTTP/gRPC is enforced by `TestAPISurfaceParity`.

**Hosted sleep cycle (`cmd/mnemos/serve_sleep.go`).** `serve` is long-lived and used to consolidate *never* — the local brain's sleep (`maybeSleep`, `sleep_schedule.go`) hangs off a Claude Code session hook a server never receives, so on a hosted brain narration accumulated, dissonance ratcheted one way, and the ADR-0019 vitals collected no time series. `startConsolidationCycle` runs a ticker: one pass ~2 minutes after boot (a server restarted daily would otherwise never reach its first 20h tick) and then every `MNEMOS_CONSOLIDATE_INTERVAL` (default `sleepInterval`, 20h; 0 disables; `serve --consolidate-interval` / `serve.consolidate_interval`). The pass is derived from `sleepArgs()` via `sleepConsolidateOptions` rather than restated, so hosted and local brains consolidate identically, and it includes the LLM session-noise clearing (`runSessionNoisePass`, extracted from `prune --session-noise`) — the only organ that LOWERS dissonance — skipped cleanly when no LLM is configured. Under `--require-tenant` each tenant partition is consolidated separately via `store.EnumerateTenants` (never the base DSN: that is an empty default namespace, or a cross-tenant write under Postgres RLS); a backend that cannot enumerate gets no pass and an error log, never a silent fallback. Ticks that land while a pass is running are skipped and counted; every pass runs behind a `recover()` and per-target error isolation, so consolidation can never take the listener down. The cycle is per process — with N replicas on one store, set the interval to 0 on all but one.

### Internal Libraries (owned by same author)

- **bolt** — structured JSON logging
- **fortify** — retry with exponential backoff and jitter
- **statekit** — declarative state machine (enforces job status transitions: pending → running → ... → completed/failed)
- **mcp-go** — MCP protocol server framework (stdio transport)

### Key Design Decisions

- **Event-sourced core**: events are immutable source of truth; claims/relationships are derived
- **Incremental trust scoring**: `PersistArtifacts` rescores only the claims a write touched — those written, plus any claim the batch attached evidence to (`trustAffectedClaimIDs`) — via the optional `ports.ScopedTrustScorer` (`RecomputeTrustForClaims`), falling back to the full `TrustScorer.RecomputeTrust` on backends that lack it. Trust is `f(confidence, evidenceCount, latestEvidence)`, so nothing else can have changed. Rescoring the whole store on every write made a write's cost grow with the brain: on an 11k-claim store every capture rewrote every row and eventually blew the governed-write budget. `mnemos recompute-trust --all` still does the full pass, for policy changes.
- **Extraction drops conversational pollution, not just harness blocks** (`internal/extract/junk.go`, `isJunkClaim`): greetings, acks, section labels, agent narration ("let me X"), meta-commentary about the graph (keyed on the *subject* being a memory noun, so real corrections survive), and **long lead-ins** — full sentences ending in a colon whose payload (a tool call, code block, list) was never captured, leaving the intro stranded as a "fact". A census of a real 5,210-claim brain found ~48% narration by hand; the shipped filter catches ~20% at ~100% precision on sampled newly-caught claims, deliberately under-catching evaluative/status fragments rather than risk dropping knowledge. `mnemos prune --narration [--dry-run]` re-runs `extract.IsJunk` (the exported filter) over already-stored claims and deprecates matches (active **and** contested — contested-at-ingest junk was auto-flagged against other junk, not human-reviewed) through the governed writer (audited, reversible) — the filters only run at ingest, so pre-existing pollution needs this pass.
- **Per-claim freshness half-life is backfillable** (`cmd/mnemos/recompute_half_life.go`): ingest stamps `extract.HalfLifeFor(type, text)` on every claim, but until #334 no backend's claim INSERT listed the column, so every row predating that fix sits at `DEFAULT 0` and decays at the 90-day durable default instead of its own 14 days. `mnemos recompute-half-life [--dry-run] [--batch N]` re-derives it over stored claims and writes through the governed writer, mirroring `recompute-contested`. Three rules make it safe: it **only ever fills a zero** (a non-zero value is a classification or a `MarkVerified` override, the exact thing #334's `CASE WHEN excluded.half_life_days > 0` conflict rule protects); it skips deprecated claims (out of recall, so writing them is cost without benefit); and it **verifies its own work** by reading each written batch back, because "wrote it and never persisted it" is the defect class it exists to repair. Batched at 500 per governed write so the cost of one dispatch never grows with the brain. Measured on a real 88,774-claim brain: 3,063 of 67,975 live claims (4.5%) matched, ~1m40s end to end, and a column-by-column diff against the untouched original showed **only** `half_life_days` changed.
- **Harness text is stripped before capture** (`cmd/mnemos/transcript_filter.go`): system reminders, task notifications, loaded SKILL.md contents, resume preambles and hook-injected context all arrive in user-role transcript messages, so capture read them as conversation and extraction turned them into claims (98 of 525 junk claims in one production brain). `stripHarnessText` removes them in `extractMessageText`; measured on a real 7 MB transcript it keeps 90.9% of text and empties only 0.9% of messages. Extraction's junk filter (`internal/extract/junk.go`) stays focused on the harder judgement of whether a human sentence asserts a fact.
- **Graceful degradation**: LLM extraction falls back to rule-based on failure; query falls back from cosine similarity to token overlap when no embeddings; grounded generation falls back to template answers when no LLM configured
- **Claim-level embeddings**: both events and claims are embedded when `--embed` is set; claims are reranked by cosine similarity at query time
- **Incremental relationship detection**: new claims are compared against existing knowledge base via `DetectIncremental`, not just within the current batch
- **Grounded generation**: `query --llm` uses the LLM to synthesize answers from retrieved claims with inline citations
- **LLM cache**: extraction results cached in `data/cache/llm-extraction/<hash>.json` (default 1 GiB cap, oldest-mtime eviction; `MNEMOS_LLM_CACHE_MAX_BYTES` overrides). Prompt version tracked at `internal/extract/prompt.go:PromptVersion` (currently `v1.4`, includes entity extraction, junk filters, richer few-shots).
- **Run isolation**: `run_id` on events enables scoped queries and extraction across ingestion runs
- **Contested detection**: happens during rule-based extraction (high token overlap + same polarity), separate from relationship detection
- **CGO_ENABLED=0**: builds are pure Go via modernc.org/sqlite (no C compiler needed)
- **XDG-compliant storage**: database defaults to `~/.local/share/mnemos/mnemos.db`, overridable via `MNEMOS_DB_URL` (any registered backend)
- **Pluggable backends (ADR 0001)**: `internal/store` is a URL-scheme dispatched registry. Providers self-register from init():
  - `sqlite://` (default, modernc.org/sqlite, FTS5)
  - `memory://` (in-process)
  - `postgres://` / `postgresql://` (pgx/v5/stdlib, namespace = Postgres schema, integration tests gated on `TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`). Verified Postgres-wire-compatible engines work through this provider unchanged: **CockroachDB**, **YugabyteDB**, **Neon serverless**, **Crunchy Bridge**, **TimescaleDB**, **AlloyDB Omni** — point `MNEMOS_DB_URL` at any of them.
  - `mysql://` / `mariadb://` (go-sql-driver/mysql, namespace = MySQL database, integration tests gated on `TEST_MYSQL_DSN`). MySQL-wire-compatible engines also work through this provider: **PlanetScale**, **TiDB**, **MariaDB**, **Vitess**.
  - `libsql://` (tursodatabase/libsql-client-go, pure-Go, supports both Turso remote URLs and local file mode). libSQL is wire-compatible with SQLite so the SQLite schema and repository implementations are reused unchanged.

  `cmd/mnemos` blank-imports providers it wants to support. When `MNEMOS_DB_URL` is unset, the resolver walks up from CWD looking for `.mnemos/mnemos.db` and falls back to the XDG global default.

## Database

SQLite with schema at `sql/sqlite/schema.sql`. Tables: `events`, `claims`, `claim_evidence`, `relationships`, `compilation_jobs`, `embeddings`. Foreign keys are enforced via `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`.

After modifying SQL queries in `sql/sqlite/query/*.sql`, run `make sqlc` to regenerate `internal/store/sqlite/sqlcgen/`.

Embeddings are stored as little-endian float32 binary BLOBs, encoded/decoded via `EncodeVector`/`DecodeVector` in `internal/embedding/`.

### Adding a claims column — the projection-drift guard

**A hand-written backend silently drops any column its projection does not name, and nothing fails.** Postgres and MySQL each keep ONE hand-maintained claim projection (`claimColumnNames`) plus a hand-written upsert. The list drifted from the schema twice — #331/#334 (`half_life_days` missing from the write path, discarded on every backend for the life of the product) and #335 (`last_verified` / `verify_count` missing from both read projections, disabling recall-based trust refresh and the salience floor that protects beliefs from being forgotten, so a hosted brain forgot what a local SQLite brain kept). Neither was caught by a test, because every affected code path *succeeds*: a write that never persists a column still commits, and a read that never selects one still scans and hands back a zero indistinguishable from "never set". SQLite is immune only because its reads are sqlc-**generated** — an omitted column fails to compile.

`internal/store/schemaguard` + `claim_projection_guard_test.go` in each backend make this a test failure. Four directions, all from static analysis of the embedded `schema.sql` and the real statement builders (`claimUpsertSQL`) — no container, so it runs in `make check` and in CI, which is the point: the two hand-written backends are exactly the two whose integration tests skip without `TEST_POSTGRES_DSN` / `TEST_MYSQL_DSN`.

1. every declared column is read (#335's direction);
2. every column in the `ON CONFLICT` / `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` set is read — a column written on conflict but not read is **zeroed across every row** touched by the read-modify-write passes (`recompute-half-life`, `prune --narration`, `recompute-contested`);
3. every read column is written by the INSERT (#331's direction);
4. every SQLite column is declared at all (cross-backend divergence: #338 scope, #339 provenance/visibility).

Deliberate omissions go in the per-backend allowlists **with a reason** — an entry with an empty reason excuses nothing, and an entry that stops being needed fails the guard as stale, so an excuse cannot outlive the thing it excuses. When adding a claims column, add it to the DDL, the INSERT list, the conflict set, `claimColumnNames` and `scanClaimRow` on both backends — or allowlist it and say why. Assert the round trip on what the **store returns** (`internal/store/claim_verification_parity_test.go`, `internal/store/claim_projection_parity_test.go`), never on what the write call was handed: a write-path test is exactly what passed throughout #331, #335 and #338.

**The conflict rule is a separate decision from the projection, and a blind one erases curation.** `half_life_days` (#334) reset a `MarkVerified` override on every re-ingest because re-extraction supplies a zero and the rule was `= excluded.x`. The scope, provenance and visibility columns Postgres and MySQL gained in #338/#339 use `CASE WHEN <incoming is non-zero> THEN <incoming> ELSE <stored> END` for the same reason: no ingest path produces any of them, and the API writers that *can* hit an existing claim id (`POST /v1/beliefs`, gRPC `WriteBeliefs`) build a claim from a request that has no scope / `citation_count` / `last_executed` / `provenance_rationale` field at all. An explicit value still wins, so nothing becomes uncorrectable; clearing a value back to empty needs a statement that owns the column, as `MarkVerified` owns `verify_count`. **SQLite still assigns these blindly** and carries the same latent erase hazard — deliberate divergence, following #340's precedent of not copying Postgres's `lifecycle` rule to MySQL. Pin the semantics with a two-write test (`claim_conflict_integration_test.go` in each backend), not a single write.

### Hand-maintained lists — the source-drift guards (`internal/sourceguard`)

**A list a human must remember to update, next to code that never reads it, is drift waiting to happen — and it never fails a test, because nothing depends on the list being right.** Same defect class as the projection drift above, one layer up. Two had already drifted when the guards were written:

- **MCP executor keys.** A tool needs three separate mentions to work: an `mcpTools()` action, a `dispatchAxiTool(..., "<tool>", ...)` call site, and an `exec.<tool>` key in `mcpExecutorMap()` — connected by nothing but the string. The v0.85.0 brain-native rename renamed the tools and the actions and *not* the executor keys, so `list_beliefs`, `list_dissonances` and `remember_episode` (a write) dispatched to unregistered executors and returned `-32603` in every release for three weeks (#341, fixed by #343). Everything else stayed green: they were registered actions, they listed in `tools/list`, they carried the right scopes.
- **`commands` in `cmd/mnemos/ux.go`**, which drives typo correction. Six dispatched commands had drifted out of it, `health` among them, so `mnemos helth` suggested nothing.

`cmd/mnemos/axikernel_executor_guard_test.go` and `cmd/mnemos/cli_commands_guard_test.go` make both a test failure, in **both** directions — the orphan direction is what identifies the cause, since three missing executors *plus* three orphaned ones is a half-finished rename where three missing and none orphaned would be an omission. Exclusions go in a per-guard allowlist with a reason, and a satisfied entry fails as stale, exactly as above.

Extraction is **AST-based, never regex** (`internal/sourceguard`), and that is load-bearing: `case "verify", "reconsolidate":` in `main.go` is a multi-value clause, and a `case "..."` regex reads only its first value and then reports `reconsolidate` as a command that does not exist. A guard that invents drift gets disabled by the first person it costs an hour. For the same reason both extractors error rather than return a short list when they meet something they cannot read (a non-literal case, a computed tool name, no call sites at all): a construct the guard skips silently is a construct drift can hide in.

### Adding a new Postgres table — RLS gotcha (per-tenant isolation)

**A new Postgres table LEAKS across tenants unless you register it in the ADR-0007 RLS `scoped` array in `internal/store/postgres/schema.sql` — not just its `CREATE TABLE`.** Per-tenant isolation within a namespace is applied by the `DO $mnemos_rls$` block, which iterates a `scoped text[]` list and, for each table, adds a `tenant` column (defaulted from the `mnemos.tenant` GUC), a tenant index, and a `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` `tenant_isolation` policy. A table absent from that list gets **no** tenant column and **no** policy, so every tenant sees every row. When you add a table used across tenants (side tables like `working_memory_blocks`, `claim_expectations` did this), add its name to `scoped`. Auth-infra tables (`users`, `revoked_tokens`) are deliberately excluded. Verify with the live-Postgres integration test (a fresh namespace should isolate).

## Configuration (env vars + YAML file)

Every setting below can come from a `MNEMOS_*` environment variable **or** a
YAML config file — mix freely. Precedence is 12-factor: an exported env var
always overrides the file; the file only fills gaps. The loader
(`internal/config`) discovers the file via `--config <path>` → `MNEMOS_CONFIG`
→ nearest `.mnemos/mnemos.yaml` (walked up from CWD) → `~/.config/mnemos/config.yaml`,
then hydrates unset `MNEMOS_*` vars in `main()` before any package reads them —
so all the `os.Getenv("MNEMOS_...")` call sites stay unchanged. An explicit
(`--config`/`MNEMOS_CONFIG`) missing or malformed file is fatal (exit `ExitConfig`);
implicit-discovery misses are silent. Unknown YAML keys are rejected. Each YAML
leaf maps to exactly one env var — see `Config.EnvOverrides` and
`mnemos.example.yaml`.

## Environment Variables

```
MNEMOS_CONFIG          # Explicit path to the YAML config file (overridden by --config).
MNEMOS_DB_URL          # Storage DSN; any registered backend (sqlite://, memory://, postgres://, mysql://, libsql://). When unset: ./.mnemos/mnemos.db (walked up) → ~/.local/share/mnemos/mnemos.db.
MNEMOS_LLM_PROVIDER    # anthropic, openai, gemini, ollama, openai-compat
MNEMOS_LLM_API_KEY     # API key for cloud providers
MNEMOS_LLM_MODEL       # Model name (e.g., llama3.2)
MNEMOS_LLM_BASE_URL    # Custom endpoint (ollama, openai-compat)
MNEMOS_EMBED_PROVIDER  # Falls back to LLM_PROVIDER if unset
MNEMOS_EMBED_API_KEY   # Falls back to LLM_API_KEY if unset
MNEMOS_EMBED_MODEL     # Embedding model name
MNEMOS_EMBED_BASE_URL  # Embedding endpoint
MNEMOS_LLM_CACHE_MAX_BYTES  # LLM extraction cache cap (default 1 GiB; 0 disables eviction)
MNEMOS_CAPTURE_TIMEOUT      # SessionEnd capture budget (Go duration, default 4m). Ceiling, not a reservation; sized for a slow local model. Bounds the whole SessionEnd drain (all chunks share it), not one chunk. `mnemos init` derives the Claude Code hook timeout from it (`captureHookTimeoutFor`, budget + 60s headroom, floor 300s) — re-run init after raising this so the installed timeout widens to match.
MNEMOS_CONSOLIDATE_INTERVAL # `mnemos serve` sleep cadence (Go duration, default 20h = sleepInterval; 0 disables). The hosted analogue of the local session-start sleep: a ticker in serve consolidates every tenant, plus one pass ~2m after boot. Per process — set 0 on all but one replica. Flag: `serve --consolidate-interval`; YAML: `serve.consolidate_interval`.
MNEMOS_DB_MAX_CONNS         # Postgres/MySQL pool MaxOpenConns (default 25)
MNEMOS_DB_MAX_IDLE_CONNS    # Postgres/MySQL pool MaxIdleConns (default 5)
MNEMOS_DB_CONN_MAX_LIFETIME # Pool ConnMaxLifetime, e.g. "30m" (default 30m)
MNEMOS_EPISODIC_EVENTS      # Truthy to enable additive episodic event typing (ADR 0023 pt2): tags source events of operational-event claims (deploy/release/merge/incident) with event_type for timeline_query. Default off; ~78% precise, purely additive (never drops a belief).
MNEMOS_TELEMETRY_OPTIN      # Truthy ("1"/"true"/"yes") to opt in to anonymized usage payload (default off)
MNEMOS_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT   # POST destination for `mnemos metrics --workspace --telemetry-send` (default unset = no send)
```

Note: Anthropic has no embedding API — use a separate provider for embeddings.

## Evaluating whether the cognitive processes actually help (`make brain-eval`)

`data/eval/*.yaml` measures **components** (did the extractor/relater/ranker produce the
right output?). It cannot measure whether the continuous processes — consolidate, forget,
reinforce, credit, salience, synthesize, decay — **improve** a brain, and until this harness
nothing did: `mnemos consolidate` prints counters (`forgotten: 412`), which establish that
the pass *ran*, not that anything got better. That made every claim about the brain
improving unfalsifiable.

`internal/brainbench` + `tools/brainbench` + `data/eval/brainbench/*.yaml` close it with a
paired A/B experiment: seed one pristine brain from a scenario corpus (offline and
deterministic — rule-based extraction, a hashed-bag-of-words stub embedder), copy the file
three times, run the process set on ONE copy, and diff the outcomes. The third copy is
untreated and measured independently to establish the noise floor; when the two untreated
arms disagree the run is reported `invalid` and no delta is attributed. Every arm is a
throwaway copy measured exactly once, because measurement is itself a mutation (recall
applies the Hebbian / reconsolidation / inhibition write-backs).

Design rules that are load-bearing, not stylistic:
- **Metrics with no defensible direction are `Descriptive` and never scored.** Forgetting
  mechanically shrinks the claim count and raises mean trust; scoring those as wins would
  report success for a process that only deleted knowledge.
- **`gold_survival` is the anti-gaming metric.** A process can raise precision and cut
  dissonance by deleting claims; only survival notices.
  `TestRun_ReportsRegressionWhenKnowledgeIsDestroyed` asserts a brain-destroying config is
  reported as a regression, so the harness provably cannot report only good news.
- **Unmeasurable means `unknown`, never 0.** 0.0 is the *best* value for free energy,
  calibration error and dissonance, so flattening would score an empty brain as healthy.
  ADR 0019's `HealthUnknown` maps straight through.
- **Activity and benefit are separate fields**, reconciled by the verdict:
  `inert-process-did-nothing` vs `ran-no-measurable-effect` vs improved/regressed/mixed.
- The limitations list ships **inside** every JSON report, because reports get pasted
  around without their README.

Not part of `make test` (each scenario seeds and measures four SQLite brains).
`make brain-eval-strict` exits non-zero on a regression; the default does not, deliberately —
gating creates pressure to weaken scenarios until they stop reporting one.

## CI

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): format check → vet → golangci-lint v2.1 → `go test -race -count=1 ./...` → `make build` → `goreleaser check`. Runs on push/PR to main.

Releases via GoReleaser (`.goreleaser.yaml`): builds both binaries for darwin/linux/windows × amd64/arm64.

### Known failure mode — tests must not touch the developer's real brain

`resolveDSN()` falls back to `~/.local/share/mnemos/mnemos.db` (the developer's global brain) when `MNEMOS_DB_URL` is unset. **Any new test binary MUST pin a throwaway DSN in `TestMain`** — as `cmd/mnemos` and the root package now do — or a test that opens a store lazily (rather than using the temp store its helper hands it) will read and WRITE production data. This once added claims to a live 118 MB brain, one per run.

It also manifests as a **load-dependent `-race` failure that looks like flakiness and is not**: `PersistArtifacts` calls the trust rescore on every write, and against a brain that grows with each polluted test run it eventually exceeds the kernel budget — surfacing as `recompute trust: list trust inputs: context deadline exceeded`. If a `-race ./...` failure reproduces under load but not in a single package, suspect a real cost that grows (data volume, unbounded work), not a flaky test.

Corollary: **`make check` omits `-race`, so a local green does not imply a green CI.** Run `make test-race` before pushing anything touching concurrency, storage, or the write path.

### Docs-only PRs and required checks

Branch protection requires four checks — `ci / Lint`, `ci / Test (ubuntu-latest)`, `ci / Build`, `ci / Security (nox)` — all produced by the shared reusable workflow (`jobs.ci` → `klarlabs-studio/.github/.../go-ci.yml`). `ci.yml` therefore does **not** `paths-ignore` markdown/docs: a `paths-ignore` there meant a docs-only PR never ran those checks, so the required checks could never report and the PR stayed BLOCKED forever (changelog PRs had to be `--admin`-merged). Because the required contexts are composed by the reusable workflow, a standalone "shim" workflow can't reproduce them — so the real `ci` job must run on every PR, docs included. The cost is running full CI on a docs-only change; docs PRs are rare (mostly changelogs), so this is accepted in exchange for normal, non-admin merges. If a required check is ever renamed, update it in branch protection, not here.
