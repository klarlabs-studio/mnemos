# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What is Mnemos?

Mnemos is a local-first evidence layer that grounds AI in truth. It extracts structured claims from text, detects contradictions between claims, and returns query answers with full evidence traceability.

Pipeline: `ingest → extract → relate → query`

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
make check          # fmt + lint + test + build (NOT -race; see make test-race)
make build          # Build bin/mnemos
make install        # Install mnemos to $GOPATH/bin
make test           # Run all tests (includes 133 eval cases across 13 suites under data/eval/*.yaml)
make test-race      # What CI actually runs (-race). `make check` omits it, so green locally != green in CI.
make fmt            # go fmt ./...
make lint           # go vet + golangci-lint
make sqlc           # Regenerate sqlc query code from sql/sqlite/
make release-check  # Validate .goreleaser.yaml
```

Run a single test:
```bash
go test -run TestName ./internal/extract/
go test -race -count=1 ./internal/store/sqlite/
```

## Architecture

### Ports & Adapters

Core interfaces live in `internal/ports/interfaces.go`. All repository methods accept `context.Context` as the first parameter for timeout/cancellation propagation:
- `EventRepository`, `ClaimRepository`, `RelationshipRepository`, `EmbeddingRepository` — storage ports
- `ExtractionEngine` — extract claims from events
- `QueryEngine` — answer questions with evidence

All implementations are behind these interfaces, enabling clean testing and provider swapping.

### Domain Model (`internal/domain/`)

- **Event** — immutable, append-only knowledge unit (tagged with `run_id` for isolation)
- **Claim** — derived assertion with type (fact/hypothesis/decision), confidence (0–1), status (active/contested/deprecated), per-claim `LastVerified` / `VerifyCount` / `HalfLifeDays`, optional `Scope{Service, Env, Team}`
- **ClaimEvidence** — links claims to source events (≥1 per claim)
- **Relationship** — claim-to-claim edge: `supports`, `contradicts`, plus the causal+outcome family from Phase 1 (`causes`, `caused_by`, `action_of`, `outcome_of`, `validates`, `refutes`, `derived_from`)
- **EmbeddingRecord** — stored vector embedding with metadata
- **Action** — recorded operational change (kind, subject, actor, at, run_id, metadata)
- **Outcome** — observed result of an Action (action_id, result, metrics map, source push|pull:*)
- **Lesson** — synthesised operational truth (statement, scope, evidence []ActionID, confidence, trigger, kind, source synthesize|human)
- **Decision** — agent decision audit record (statement, plan, reasoning, risk_level, beliefs []ClaimID, alternatives, outcome_id)
- **Playbook** — Agent-ready response (trigger, scope, steps []PlaybookStep, derived_from_lessons, confidence). Consumers run them through whatever execution layer they own.
- **Scope** — multi-tenant filter primitive: {Service, Env, Team} (LessonScope is an alias kept for back-compat)
- **Answer** — query result bundling claims, contradictions, timeline, hop distances, claim provenance, and `StaleClaimIDs`

All domain types have `Validate()` methods. Contradictions are first-class concepts, not afterthoughts.

### Entrypoints

- `cmd/mnemos/` — CLI subcommands:
  - Setup: `init` (system-detecting one-command bootstrap: brain + config + MCP registration + Claude Code hooks + skills; `--project`, `--dry-run`, `--yes`, `--no-hooks`, `--no-skills`, `--hooks`, `--no-mcp`, `--db <dsn>`, `--force`; `--url <endpoint> [--token]` registers a remote HTTP MCP server for a hosted brain **and** installs recall/brief/capture hooks that call the hosted brain over REST (writing the URL/token to the 0600 config, never inlined into Claude settings); `--service [--out]` scaffolds a `mnemos serve` deployment bundle via `scaffoldService`), `setup` (minimal MCP-only registration), `hook <recall|brief|capture>` (internal Claude Code hook handlers, read event JSON on stdin, fail-open). **Hosted vs local hooks:** when `MNEMOS_URL` is set (hosted, via the `server:` config block → `MNEMOS_URL`/`MNEMOS_TOKEN`), the hooks route through the `client` package to REST — recall→`GET /v1/search`, brief→`GET /v1/metrics`, capture→`POST /v1/process` — with a bearer token; otherwise they open the local store (`hostedConfigured()`/`hostedClient()` in `hook.go`). `/v1/process` (`makeProcessHandler`) is the REST analogue of the `process_text` MCP tool — it runs the full ingest→extract→relate pipeline server-side; `use_llm`/`use_embeddings` are tri-state (`*bool`), so an omitting hook lets the server default to its own LLM config instead of hard-failing. `init --db` accepts any store DSN (sqlite/postgres/mysql/libsql); it opens the DSN first (connectivity check + schema bootstrap) and fails fast if unreachable (unless `--force`). Credential hygiene: a credential-free DSN (local SQLite/memory) is inlined into Claude's config; a networked DSN with a password is written to the 0600 config file (via `config.SetValues`) and discovered by the server/hooks, never inlined into `~/.claude.json`/`settings.json`. Setup logic lives in `init.go`/`setup.go`/`detect.go`/`hooks_install.go`/`skills_install.go`; the same plan/apply engine backs the `configure_environment` MCP tool.
  - **Skills (manual brief/capture).** `init` also installs two Claude Code skills into `<.claude>/skills/` — `/mnemos-brief` and `/mnemos-capture` — the on-demand counterparts to the `SessionStart` brief and `SessionEnd` capture hooks. They are markdown embedded in the binary (`cmd/mnemos/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `//go:embed`) and installed by `installSkills` in `skills_install.go`: idempotent (identical content is a no-op), backing up any divergent prior version as `.bak-mnemos`, mirroring `installHooks`. The names are `mnemos-`-prefixed deliberately — bare `brief`/`capture` collide with the Agent OS memory skills. Skills carry no DSN and no token (they instruct the agent to use the MCP tools, CLI only as fallback), so they install identically in local and hosted mode and are independent of `--no-hooks`. Opt out with `--no-skills` (`noSkills` on `configure_environment`). Adding a skill directory requires registering it in `skillNames`, enforced by `TestSkills_EmbeddedMatchesRegistered`.
  - Core: `ingest`, `extract` (supports `--run`), `relate`, `process`, `query`, `metrics`, `verify`
  - Phase 2: `action record/list`, `outcome record/list`
  - Phase 3: `synthesize`, `lessons [--service|--trigger]`
  - Phase 5: `decision record/list/show/attach-outcome`
  - Phase 6: `playbook synthesize/list/show/<trigger>`
  - Phase 7: `export --kind=lesson|playbook`, `import <file.md>`, `history --kind=lesson|playbook`
- `mnemos mcp` — MCP server exposing `query_knowledge`, `process_text`, `knowledge_metrics`, `configure_environment`, `record_action`, `record_outcome`, `synthesize_lessons`, `query_lessons`, `record_decision`, `query_decisions`, `query_playbook`, `synthesize_playbooks`, `list_claims`, `list_decisions`, `list_contradictions`, `watch_file`, `ingest_git_log`, `ingest_git_prs`. Default transport is stdio (local Claude Code). `mnemos mcp --http <addr> [--auth|--no-auth]` serves the identical tool set over Streamable HTTP so remote MCP clients can reach a hosted brain — `--auth` (default for `--http`) gates every request behind a bearer JWT via the mcp-go `transport.WithAuthorize` hook (`serveMCPHTTP` in `cmd/mnemos/mcp_http.go`, reusing the same `auth.Verifier` as `serve`'s gRPC); TLS from `MNEMOS_TLS_*`. Per-request identity: `transport.WithRequestContextFn` stashes the validated `*auth.Claims` in each request's context (`mcp_identity.go`); write handlers attribute `created_by` to the token subject via `mcpActorFor(ctx, fallback)` (through both the direct and axi-kernel executor paths), and run-scoped reads enforce the token's run allowlist via `mcpRunAllowed`. Stdio has no claims, so both fall back to the process actor / no restriction — unchanged. **Per-tool scopes (`mcp_scopes.go`):** every `tools/call` is gated on the token's `scp` claim by `mcpScopeMiddleware`, a single middleware in `mcpMiddlewareStack` — REST gates writes with `requireScope` and gRPC with its interceptor, but MCP authenticated without ever reading `scp`, so a token minted `--scope claims:read` was refused `POST /v1/beliefs` and then allowed to call `process_text`, `remember`, `forget` and every other write tool. `mcpToolScopes` maps each tool to its required scope (reads `""`; writes `claims:write`/`events:write`; `memory_promote` → `promote:global`; `configure_environment` → `*`, since over HTTP it writes the *server's* filesystem). Unmapped tools fail closed to `*`. `TestMCPToolScopes_CoversEveryRegisteredTool` (against the live `srv.Tool` list) and `TestMCPToolScopes_AgreeWithKernelEffects` (against the axi-kernel read/write effects) make an unclassified new tool a build failure; `TestMCPMiddlewareStack_EnforcesScopes` pins the wiring, not just the guard. Stdio carries no claims and is unaffected.

**Multi-tenant per server (ADR 0007, Phase 1):** `mcp --http --require-tenant` serves many tenants from one process. The JWT carries a `tnt` claim (`Claims.Tenant`; mint with `token issue --tenant` / `agent token issue --tenant`). In this mode the auth hook **denies** a token without a valid tenant (fail-closed), `withTenant` stashes the effective tenant, and `resolveDSNForContext` scopes the request per backend; the cognitive path routes through a per-tenant `memFacade.Tenant()` cache. **Two isolation models (`internal/store.TenancyModeForDSN`):** Postgres uses **row-level** isolation — `resolveDSNForContext` appends `?tenant=<id>`, the provider pins the `mnemos.tenant` GUC, and RLS isolates the request (needs a non-superuser role — superusers bypass RLS). sqlite / mysql / **local** libSQL use **namespace-per-tenant** physical isolation — `resolveDSNForContext` sets `?namespace=<derived>` where the derived namespace is `store.TenantNamespace(tenant)` (a `t_`-prefixed, hash-suffixed, charset-safe mapping since the tenant charset is broader than the namespace charset), and the provider partitions into a separate schema/database/file created on first open. Backends that cannot isolate — `memory://` and **remote** libSQL (it discards `namespace`) — report `TenancyNone` and `--require-tenant` refuses to start (fail-closed). The reserved default namespace `mnemos` is the namespace-model analogue of the reserved `__default__` tenant: a derived tenant namespace can never equal it. Guardrails: `TestSQLite_CrossTenantIsolation`, `TestLibsql_LocalCrossTenantIsolation`, `TestMySQL_CrossTenantIsolation`, `TestGRPC_CrossTenantIsolation_SQLite`, `TestTenant_SQLiteNamespaceIsolation`, plus the Postgres RLS suite. **Connection reuse:** the MCP server caches one read pool per tenant-scoped DSN (`enableConnCache` in `dsn.go`; keyed by the resolved DSN incl. `?tenant=`, so tenants never share a pool and RLS is unchanged) — reads reuse a pooled conn instead of opening one per request. Writes (`openWriter`) stay per-request. **Phase 2 (opt-in, `MNEMOS_PG_SHARED_POOL`/`db.shared_pool`):** one shared Postgres pool serves all tenants — a per-request `*sql.Conn` is checked out, pinned with `SET mnemos.tenant`, and its Closer runs `RESET mnemos.tenant` before releasing it (fail-closed if ever reused unset). Repos take a `pgQuerier` interface (`*sql.DB` for the default per-tenant-pool path, `*sql.Conn` for shared); `openSharedTenantConn`/`getSharedPool` in `internal/store/postgres/postgres.go`. The cmd conn-cache is disabled in this mode (it would pin one conn per tenant). Default stays the per-tenant-pool model. Verified by `TestPostgres_CrossTenantIsolation` (both modes, skips on an RLS-bypassing role) — the ADR-0007 guardrail — plus an MCP e2e showing 30 mixed-tenant requests share ~2 connections.
- `mnemos serve [--grpc-port N]` — REST + gRPC API service (the "as a service" surface; JWT auth, TLS/mTLS, multi-tenant namespace/RLS). `serve --require-tenant` (ADR 0007) makes every REST **and** gRPC request scope to its token's `tnt` claim via a per-request tenant connection (Postgres RLS or namespace-per-tenant for sqlite/mysql/local libSQL — see the MCP note above): REST auths reads too and a `tenantScopeMiddleware` opens the tenant conn (handlers resolve it through `scopedConn/scopedWriter/scopedMem` in `serve_tenant.go`); gRPC's interceptor opens it and methods resolve via `connFor/writerFor/memFor` (`internal/server/grpc`). Secure by default (v0.85.1+): every data endpoint requires a JWT (reads too); only bare-liveness/static infra endpoints (`/health`, `/healthz`, `/`, `/app`) stay unauthenticated. `/internal/metrics` is **authenticated by default** (opt out with `serve --metrics-public`; it is excluded from the `--public-reads` bypass) and the version/DB-probe report lives behind auth at `/internal/ready`. Anonymous reads are an explicit opt-in (`serve --public-reads`); `mcp --http` defaults to `--auth`. Guarded by `TestREST_ReadsRequireAuthByDefault`, `TestAuthenticate_ReadsRequireTokenByDefault`, `TestPostgres_CrossTenantIsolation`, `TestGRPC_CrossTenantIsolation`, and `TestGRPC_CrossTenantIsolation_SQLite`. Distinct from the MCP surface; API parity across MCP/HTTP/gRPC is enforced by `TestAPISurfaceParity`.

### Internal Libraries (owned by same author)

- **bolt** — structured JSON logging
- **fortify** — retry with exponential backoff and jitter
- **statekit** — declarative state machine (enforces job status transitions: pending → running → ... → completed/failed)
- **mcp-go** — MCP protocol server framework (stdio transport)

### Key Design Decisions

- **Event-sourced core**: events are immutable source of truth; claims/relationships are derived
- **Incremental trust scoring**: `PersistArtifacts` rescores only the claims a write touched — those written, plus any claim the batch attached evidence to (`trustAffectedClaimIDs`) — via the optional `ports.ScopedTrustScorer` (`RecomputeTrustForClaims`), falling back to the full `TrustScorer.RecomputeTrust` on backends that lack it. Trust is `f(confidence, evidenceCount, latestEvidence)`, so nothing else can have changed. Rescoring the whole store on every write made a write's cost grow with the brain: on an 11k-claim store every capture rewrote every row and eventually blew the governed-write budget. `mnemos recompute-trust --all` still does the full pass, for policy changes.
- **Extraction drops conversational pollution, not just harness blocks** (`internal/extract/junk.go`, `isJunkClaim`): greetings, acks, section labels, agent narration ("let me X"), meta-commentary about the graph (keyed on the *subject* being a memory noun, so real corrections survive), and **long lead-ins** — full sentences ending in a colon whose payload (a tool call, code block, list) was never captured, leaving the intro stranded as a "fact". A census of a real 5,210-claim brain found ~48% narration by hand; the shipped filter catches ~20% at ~100% precision on sampled newly-caught claims, deliberately under-catching evaluative/status fragments rather than risk dropping knowledge. `mnemos prune --narration [--dry-run]` re-runs `extract.IsJunk` (the exported filter) over already-stored claims and deprecates matches (active **and** contested — contested-at-ingest junk was auto-flagged against other junk, not human-reviewed) through the governed writer (audited, reversible) — the filters only run at ingest, so pre-existing pollution needs this pass.
- **Harness text is stripped before capture** (`cmd/mnemos/transcript_filter.go`): system reminders, task notifications, loaded SKILL.md contents, resume preambles and hook-injected context all arrive in user-role transcript messages, so capture read them as conversation and extraction turned them into claims (98 of 525 junk claims in one production brain). `stripHarnessText` removes them in `extractMessageText`; measured on a real 7 MB transcript it keeps 90.9% of text and empties only 0.9% of messages. Extraction's junk filter (`internal/extract/junk.go`) stays focused on the harder judgement of whether a human sentence asserts a fact.
- **Graceful degradation**: LLM extraction falls back to rule-based on failure; query falls back from cosine similarity to token overlap when no embeddings; grounded generation falls back to template answers when no LLM configured
- **Claim-level embeddings**: both events and claims are embedded when `--embed` is set; claims are reranked by cosine similarity at query time
- **Incremental relationship detection**: new claims are compared against existing knowledge base via `DetectIncremental`, not just within the current batch
- **Grounded generation**: `query --llm` uses the LLM to synthesize answers from retrieved claims with inline citations
- **LLM cache**: extraction results cached in `data/cache/llm-extraction/<hash>.json` (default 1 GiB cap, oldest-mtime eviction; `MNEMOS_LLM_CACHE_MAX_BYTES` overrides). Prompt version tracked at `internal/extract/prompt.go:PromptVersion` (currently `v1.4`, includes entity extraction, junk filters, richer few-shots).
- **Run isolation**: `run_id` on events enables scoped queries and extraction across ingestion runs
- **Contested detection**: happens during rule-based extraction (high token overlap + same polarity), separate from relationship detection
- **CGO_ENABLED=0**: builds are pure Go via modernc.org/sqlite (no C compiler needed)
- **XDG-compliant storage**: database defaults to `~/.local/share/mnemos/mnemos.db`, overridable via `MNEMOS_DB_URL` (any registered backend)
- **Pluggable backends (ADR 0001)**: `internal/store` is a URL-scheme dispatched registry. Providers self-register from init():
  - `sqlite://` (default, modernc.org/sqlite, FTS5)
  - `memory://` (in-process)
  - `postgres://` / `postgresql://` (pgx/v5/stdlib, namespace = Postgres schema, integration tests gated on `TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`). Verified Postgres-wire-compatible engines work through this provider unchanged: **CockroachDB**, **YugabyteDB**, **Neon serverless**, **Crunchy Bridge**, **TimescaleDB**, **AlloyDB Omni** — point `MNEMOS_DB_URL` at any of them.
  - `mysql://` / `mariadb://` (go-sql-driver/mysql, namespace = MySQL database, integration tests gated on `TEST_MYSQL_DSN`). MySQL-wire-compatible engines also work through this provider: **PlanetScale**, **TiDB**, **MariaDB**, **Vitess**.
  - `libsql://` (tursodatabase/libsql-client-go, pure-Go, supports both Turso remote URLs and local file mode). libSQL is wire-compatible with SQLite so the SQLite schema and repository implementations are reused unchanged.

  `cmd/mnemos` blank-imports providers it wants to support. When `MNEMOS_DB_URL` is unset, the resolver walks up from CWD looking for `.mnemos/mnemos.db` and falls back to the XDG global default.

## Database

SQLite with schema at `sql/sqlite/schema.sql`. Tables: `events`, `claims`, `claim_evidence`, `relationships`, `compilation_jobs`, `embeddings`. Foreign keys are enforced via `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`.

After modifying SQL queries in `sql/sqlite/query/*.sql`, run `make sqlc` to regenerate `internal/store/sqlite/sqlcgen/`.

Embeddings are stored as little-endian float32 binary BLOBs, encoded/decoded via `EncodeVector`/`DecodeVector` in `internal/embedding/`.

### Adding a new Postgres table — RLS gotcha (per-tenant isolation)

**A new Postgres table LEAKS across tenants unless you register it in the ADR-0007 RLS `scoped` array in `internal/store/postgres/schema.sql` — not just its `CREATE TABLE`.** Per-tenant isolation within a namespace is applied by the `DO $mnemos_rls$` block, which iterates a `scoped text[]` list and, for each table, adds a `tenant` column (defaulted from the `mnemos.tenant` GUC), a tenant index, and a `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` `tenant_isolation` policy. A table absent from that list gets **no** tenant column and **no** policy, so every tenant sees every row. When you add a table used across tenants (side tables like `working_memory_blocks`, `claim_expectations` did this), add its name to `scoped`. Auth-infra tables (`users`, `revoked_tokens`) are deliberately excluded. Verify with the live-Postgres integration test (a fresh namespace should isolate).

## Configuration (env vars + YAML file)

Every setting below can come from a `MNEMOS_*` environment variable **or** a
YAML config file — mix freely. Precedence is 12-factor: an exported env var
always overrides the file; the file only fills gaps. The loader
(`internal/config`) discovers the file via `--config <path>` → `MNEMOS_CONFIG`
→ nearest `.mnemos/mnemos.yaml` (walked up from CWD) → `~/.config/mnemos/config.yaml`,
then hydrates unset `MNEMOS_*` vars in `main()` before any package reads them —
so all the `os.Getenv("MNEMOS_...")` call sites stay unchanged. An explicit
(`--config`/`MNEMOS_CONFIG`) missing or malformed file is fatal (exit `ExitConfig`);
implicit-discovery misses are silent. Unknown YAML keys are rejected. Each YAML
leaf maps to exactly one env var — see `Config.EnvOverrides` and
`mnemos.example.yaml`.

## Environment Variables

```
MNEMOS_CONFIG          # Explicit path to the YAML config file (overridden by --config).
MNEMOS_DB_URL          # Storage DSN; any registered backend (sqlite://, memory://, postgres://, mysql://, libsql://). When unset: ./.mnemos/mnemos.db (walked up) → ~/.local/share/mnemos/mnemos.db.
MNEMOS_LLM_PROVIDER    # anthropic, openai, gemini, ollama, openai-compat
MNEMOS_LLM_API_KEY     # API key for cloud providers
MNEMOS_LLM_MODEL       # Model name (e.g., llama3.2)
MNEMOS_LLM_BASE_URL    # Custom endpoint (ollama, openai-compat)
MNEMOS_EMBED_PROVIDER  # Falls back to LLM_PROVIDER if unset
MNEMOS_EMBED_API_KEY   # Falls back to LLM_API_KEY if unset
MNEMOS_EMBED_MODEL     # Embedding model name
MNEMOS_EMBED_BASE_URL  # Embedding endpoint
MNEMOS_LLM_CACHE_MAX_BYTES  # LLM extraction cache cap (default 1 GiB; 0 disables eviction)
MNEMOS_CAPTURE_TIMEOUT      # SessionEnd capture budget (Go duration, default 4m). Ceiling, not a reservation; sized for a slow local model. Bounds the whole SessionEnd drain (all chunks share it), not one chunk. `mnemos init` derives the Claude Code hook timeout from it (`captureHookTimeoutFor`, budget + 60s headroom, floor 300s) — re-run init after raising this so the installed timeout widens to match.
MNEMOS_DB_MAX_CONNS         # Postgres/MySQL pool MaxOpenConns (default 25)
MNEMOS_DB_MAX_IDLE_CONNS    # Postgres/MySQL pool MaxIdleConns (default 5)
MNEMOS_DB_CONN_MAX_LIFETIME # Pool ConnMaxLifetime, e.g. "30m" (default 30m)
MNEMOS_EPISODIC_EVENTS      # Truthy to enable additive episodic event typing (ADR 0023 pt2): tags source events of operational-event claims (deploy/release/merge/incident) with event_type for timeline_query. Default off; ~78% precise, purely additive (never drops a belief).
MNEMOS_TELEMETRY_OPTIN      # Truthy ("1"/"true"/"yes") to opt in to anonymized usage payload (default off)
MNEMOS_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT   # POST destination for `mnemos metrics --workspace --telemetry-send` (default unset = no send)
```

Note: Anthropic has no embedding API — use a separate provider for embeddings.

## CI

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): format check → vet → golangci-lint v2.1 → `go test -race -count=1 ./...` → `make build` → `goreleaser check`. Runs on push/PR to main.

Releases via GoReleaser (`.goreleaser.yaml`): builds both binaries for darwin/linux/windows × amd64/arm64.
