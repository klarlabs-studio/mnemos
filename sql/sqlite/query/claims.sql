-- ON CONFLICT preserves trust_score and valid_to (computed/managed
-- separately via UpdateClaimTrust and SetClaimValidity), but does
-- refresh valid_from: re-extracting a claim with newer evidence is
-- a legitimate "this fact is observed again from <ts>" signal.
--
-- half_life_days is written on INSERT because the ingest pipeline
-- classifies claim volatility and stamps a shorter freshness half-life
-- on assertions about mutable system state. Omitting it here dropped
-- that classification at the store boundary, so every row in existence
-- kept the DEFAULT 0 and decayed at the 90-day durable default (#331).
--
-- On CONFLICT the incoming value only wins when non-zero. A re-extracted
-- claim carries no half-life (the classifier returns 0 for anything it is
-- not confident about), so a plain excluded.half_life_days would reset a
-- human override set through MarkVerified the next time the same claim
-- came back through ingest. Same COALESCE semantics as MarkClaimVerified.
