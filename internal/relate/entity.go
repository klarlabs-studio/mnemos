// proper-noun-shaped values.
//
// Example: "The CEO is Alice" vs "The CEO is Bob" share `ceo` but
// disagree on the entity (Alice vs Bob). The token-overlap path
// rejects these as too short for value-divergence; this path catches
// them.
//
// Heuristic:
//   - Both claims must, after stop-word removal, fit in ≤4 content
//     tokens (the heuristic targets short copular statements; longer
//     claims are handled by detectValueDivergence and the polarity
//     path).
//   - They must share ≥1 content token (the role/subject anchor).
//   - Each must have ≥1 token that the other doesn't, and at least
//     one of those differing tokens must be a proper-noun-shaped
//     literal in the original text (capitalized, alphabetic).
//
// Out of scope: cross-language proper-noun resolution, alias
// reconciliation ("Alice Smith" vs "Alice"), pronoun resolution.

// this function's test name ("SkipsSentenceInitialAndStopWords"): any
// capitalized non-stop-word opening a sentence was read as a proper noun. In
// production that made ordinary fragments look like competing named entities —
// "Now the overlay" vs "Clear picture now" was recorded as a contradiction
// because "Now" and "Clear" were taken for names diverging over the shared
// token "now". Neither is followed by a copula; "Alice is the CEO" is.
