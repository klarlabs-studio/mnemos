// Package trust derives a single, comparable trust_score for each
// claim from three independent signals: the LLM-assigned confidence,

//
// Why this exists. A raw LLM "confidence" field treats a verbatim
// citation and a hallucination identically — both come back as ~0.9.
// Ranking by it produces nonsense. The trust_score below adds two
// signals the LLM cannot fake: how many independent events back the
// claim, and how recently any of them was observed. Together they
// approximate the question a human reader would actually ask: "do I
// have any reason to believe this is still true?"
