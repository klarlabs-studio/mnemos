// Claim volatility: how fast a claim's truth decays with age.
//
// Every claim mnemos captures gets the same 90-day freshness half-life
// (trust.FreshnessHalfLifeDays), because HalfLifeDays is read everywhere —
// trust scoring, staleness, curiosity, query — and set nowhere except explicit
// human verification. So a claim about what is currently installed recalls at
// the same confidence on day 30 as a claim about why a design decision was
// made.
//
// That is the mechanism behind a whole class of stale-belief incidents: "we're
// not using warden", "briefkasten is an HTTP MCP server, not stdio", "mnemos
// doesn't work". Each was TRUE when written. None was wrong at write time —
// they were assertions about mutable system state that kept recalling at full
// confidence long after the state moved.
//
// The classifier below only shortens the half-life, and only on a confident
// signal. That direction is deliberate. Mis-classifying a durable claim as
// volatile decays real knowledge out of recall — an invisible loss. Missing a
// volatile claim just leaves today's behaviour. When unsure, do nothing.

// VolatileHalfLifeDays is the freshness half-life for claims about mutable
// system state. Roughly a fortnight: long enough that a claim stays useful
// across a working sprint, short enough that a month-old assertion about what
// is installed or running no longer recalls as settled fact.

// durable) does not match while "postgres is running on port 5432" does.

// 90-day freshness while being false. Same meaning, different bytes.

// This is deliberately ONLY typography. It does not widen what counts as a
// state claim: phrasings like "not using X" or "is an HTTP MCP server" are left
// unmatched on purpose, because "using" and "is a/an X" appear just as often in
// durable claims ("we're using Postgres", "mnemos is a local-first evidence

// over-catching loses knowledge silently.
