// Claim admission: the single gate every claim must pass before it can appear
// in an Answer, whichever way it was retrieved.
//
// # WHY THIS IS ONE FUNCTION
//
// The chain used to live inline in answerWithEvents and applied only to the
// directly-retrieved claims. Hop expansion (--hops / AnswerOptions.Hops)
// appended its results RAW, so every filter was escapable by asking for one
// hop: a claim deprecated by `forget` / `memory_deprecate` came back through an
// edge, and --scope, --visibility, --lifecycle, --min-trust and --at were all
// bypassable the same way. Hop results also skipped the credibility rescore, so
// they carried their raw stored trust_score while direct hits carried a
// recomputed one — and then the two were ranked against each other on different
// scales.
//
// Both are the same bug: a second entry into the answer set that did not go
// through the gate. Keeping the gate in one function is the fix; duplicating
// the chain would just recreate the drift.

// rescoreCredibility fills each claim's derived provenance fields (execution
// time, liveness) and computes its credibility from the current provenance
// signals, in place. Every claim that reaches an Answer must be rescored, so
// claims from different retrieval paths carry comparable credibility.
//
// It no longer overwrites TrustScore (ADR 0026 §2). It used to, which made
// recall report, filter on and resolve contradictions with a different number
// from the trust Get, the API and brain health reported for the same belief at
// the same instant. Credibility is now its own field; TrustScore stays the
// canonical stored trust.

	// claims on one real brain carry a `session` verdict, and every one was
	// eligible for recall — so those fragments kept being injected as context at
	// trust scores around 0.67.

	// Filtering at recall rather than deleting is the proportionate move. The
	// verdict comes from a classifier with a measured error profile that
	// over-calls durable (it under-suppresses), and a claim wrongly judged
	// session-local should cost one absent recall, not an erased belief. Nothing
	// is deprecated, nothing is deleted, every audit path still sees them: this
