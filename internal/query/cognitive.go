// The cognitive retrieval behaviours (ADR 0013 §2/§4, ADR 0015 §4/§5, ADR 0016)
// are ON unless explicitly disabled, except spreading activation, which is
// opt-in since ADR 0030 (see SPREADING ACTIVATION IS OPT-IN below).
//
// # WHY ON BY DEFAULT
//
// They are not optional enhancements; they are the memory model. Spreading
// activation primes associations, salience biases toward stakes, Hebbian
// strengthens what fires together, reconsolidation keeps recalled memories
// alive against decay, and inhibition suppresses a contradiction's beaten
// loser. A store that does none of these is a similarity search over rows, not
// a brain — and a brain that never reinforces what it retrieves is the one
// thing a memory system must not be.
//
// Three of them WRITE during a read, which is why they were originally opt-in.
// That instinct is HTTP orthodoxy applied where it does not belong: in a memory
// system retrieval IS a write — that is the testing effect, and the entire
// point of reconsolidation. The writes are bounded and best-effort by
// construction, they are tenant-scoped like every other write, and backends
// that cannot persist edge strength skip them. Nothing about "GET" makes
// forgetting correct.
//
// Opting out stays available per-variable, because a genuinely read-only
// deployment (a replica, a forensic copy, a migration dry-run) is a real thing:
//
//	MNEMOS_HEBBIAN=false        # or 0 / no / off
//
// # SPREADING ACTIVATION IS OPT-IN (ADR 0030)
//
// Measured on LoCoMo (#441 Phase A, #456): with spreading activation on, the
// belief containing the answer ranked in recall's top 5 for 15.6% of
// answerable questions. With it off, the figure was 39.4%; switching off
// salience, Hebbian, reconsolidation or inhibition changed nothing. Priming
// re-sorts the retrieved beliefs by their supports edges to the top seeds,
// and with up to 20 supports edges per belief (ADR 0027) that lifts whole
// clusters about the same subject above the belief that answers the
// question. It stays available (--prime, MNEMOS_SPREADING_ACTIVATION=true);
// it becomes a default again only when a bounded form shows a measured gain.
//
// # WHAT THIS FIXES
//
// These options were previously set in exactly ONE place — the CLI `query`
// command. MCP (`query_knowledge`, `recall`), REST (`/v1/search`) and the
// embedded store all constructed AnswerOptions without them, so every field sat
// at its zero value. No env var or config could change that: the code path
// simply never assigned the fields. The features were implemented, tested and
// documented, and unreachable from every surface anyone actually uses.
