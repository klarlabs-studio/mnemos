// Recall-driven durability classification.
//
// The demotion added for session-local beliefs can only act on beliefs that
// have a verdict, and `classify-durability` fills those in as a BULK pass —
// which is the one thing that cannot reach what a reader actually sees. Recall
// ranks by relevance to a question, so no static ordering over the brain
// predicts which beliefs surface: ordering by trust was measured and failed
// (trust is blind to durability and clustered, with 9,935 beliefs at >= 0.79),
// and recency discriminates only weakly (52% against 38%).
//
// The beliefs a brief just displayed are, by definition, exactly the ones worth
// a verdict. So recall hands those ids to a detached worker. Coverage then
// grows along the path the reader actually walks instead of sweeping a brain
// that takes hours to cover, and it converges: once a topic's beliefs are
// judged, recalling it again spawns nothing.
//
// Everything here is best-effort and off the critical path. A brief must never
// wait on, or fail because of, a classification.

// recallClassifyInterval throttles the worker. Recall runs on every prompt and
// the model is often local, so without a floor a fast exchange would queue
// several classifications at once and contend for the same GPU.
