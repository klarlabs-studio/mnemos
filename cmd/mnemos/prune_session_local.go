// `mnemos prune --session-local [--dry-run]` retires beliefs an LLM already
// judged SESSION-LOCAL — statements tied to the moment they were written rather
// than knowledge that outlives it.
//
// It is the sibling of `prune --narration`. That one re-runs the rule-based junk
// filter; this one acts on a verdict the durability classifier has already
// recorded on the claim, so it needs no model at all and is purely a write.
//
// # WHY DEPRECATION IS THE RIGHT VERB
//
// `prune --session-noise` drops contradiction EDGES between two session-local
// claims. That leaves the claims themselves live, and measurement showed why
// that is not enough: on a real brain only 209 of 25,074 live contradictions had
// session-local on BOTH sides, while 10,354 had it on at least one. Edge pruning
// cannot reach the asymmetric majority, because a narration fragment arguing
// with an unclassified one is not a pair of session-local claims — it is one
// piece of narration that should not have been a belief.
//
// Retiring the claim reaches all of them at once, and the health vital is built
// to reward exactly that: `hypercorrectionList` skips any contradiction with a
// deprecated endpoint, and its own comment records that this was a bug fix
// precisely so "the brain-health vital could be improved by retiring bad
// beliefs".
//
// # WHY IT IS SAFE
//
// Deprecation is reduced retrievability, never erasure: the claim keeps its
// evidence and its history (both visible in `mnemos audit`), and the transition
// lands a claim_status_history row through the governed writer. Recall excludes
// deprecated claims unconditionally — --include-history widens valid time, not
// status — so this pass removes them from recall. Nothing is deleted, which is
// what keeps it recoverable; deletion would not be.
//
// The verdict it acts on comes from a classifier with a measured error profile
// that OVER-calls durable — it under-suppresses rather than over-suppresses — so
// the population it retires is conservative by construction. And these claims
// are already excluded from recall, so this makes the store agree with what the
// reader has been seeing rather than changing what anyone can retrieve.
//
// Unknown/unclassified durability is never touched: "not yet judged" is not
// "narration", and treating it as such would retire the brain.
