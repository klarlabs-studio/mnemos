  what these mean
    A brain is healthy when its model of the world keeps prediction error low: it
    is not surprised by what it later observes, its confidence matches its accuracy,
    and it does not hold beliefs that flatly contradict each other. The verdict is
    worst-wins — the single worst line sets the overall status, so one sick vital is
    never hidden by healthy neighbours.

    vitals — each is 0..1, higher is worse, with its own warn and critical line
      free_energy   aggregate prediction-error signal, and a pointer to the layer
                    most wrong. The headline number; the rest explain it.
      calibration   when the brain says it is 80% sure, is it right about 80% of the
                    time? Confidently wrong is worse than unsure.
      dissonance    active, high-stakes contradictions per belief — conflicts between
                    beliefs established enough that a disagreement means something.
      low_trust     share of currently-valid beliefs whose trust has decayed below a
                    floor as their evidence ages without re-verification.
      staleness     share of valid beliefs not seen or re-verified within the horizon
                    — "still load-bearing, or just still present?"
      trust_decay   share of still-trusted beliefs that fall below the same floor
                    within a month if nobody re-verifies them, each decaying at its
                    own half-life. low_trust is what has already gone; this is what
                    is going. A month of re-verification work, named in advance.
      skill_coverage share of recorded actions whose outcome was ever observed — an
                    action with no outcome teaches the brain nothing.

    A vital marked [ ?? ] is unknown: nothing has been measured for it yet. That
    is not a pass. It never worsens the overall verdict either — absence of
    evidence of a problem is not evidence of one.

    integrity — structural smell tests, not cognitive ones
      orphan_claims       beliefs with zero evidence; every belief should trace to a
                          source, so these should not exist.
      dangling_edges      relationships pointing at a belief that is gone.
      stale_expectations  predictions the brain made and never reconciled.

    Thresholds ship as conservative defaults and are being calibrated against real
    snapshots — run 'mnemos health --journal' to add to that series. Full design
    rationale lives in the repo (docs/adr/0019).
