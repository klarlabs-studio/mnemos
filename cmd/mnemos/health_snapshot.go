// Automatic brain-health snapshots.
//
// ADR 0019 shipped the five vitals with thresholds it openly called
// "conservative defaults", and said tuning them against real data "is exactly
// what the journal (ADR 0018) now enables". That tuning never became possible:
// recording a snapshot requires `mnemos health --journal`, nothing runs it on a
// cadence, and so the journal stays empty. Measured on a real brain after
// months of use it held zero rows of any kind — the time series the thresholds
// were meant to be calibrated from had never collected a single point, so
// "degraded" and "unhealthy" have never been grounded verdicts for anyone.
//
// Session start is the natural cadence: once per session, already a moment the
// hooks run. But a health snapshot is a full scan — 7.5s on a 19,640-claim
// brain, and it grows with the brain — and SessionStart is latency-sensitive,
// so it is spawned detached and rate-limited rather than run inline.
//
// It is best-effort in every direction. A failure to snapshot must never cost
// the user their brief.

// healthSnapshotInterval is the minimum gap between automatic snapshots. Daily
// is enough to calibrate a threshold and cheap enough to be invisible; the
// vital moves over days of use, not minutes.

// a new machine should collect a point, and a corrupt stamp should not silence
