// Autonomous consolidation — the brain's sleep.
//
// A biological brain does not recover on demand; it consolidates on a cycle,
// mostly during sleep — moving the day's episodic traces into integrated
// knowledge, replaying what mattered, letting the trivial decay, and clearing
// the metabolic waste of a waking day. Mnemos has every one of those organs
// (`consolidate`: dedupe, trust refresh, forget, reinforce, plus session-noise
// clearing), but nothing ran them on a clock for a local brain — so the day's
// narration accumulated until someone ran a pass by hand. A brain that only
// consolidates when poked has insomnia; its dissonance climbs all day and never
// falls.
//
// This gives the local brain a sleep cycle. Once a day, when a session starts
// after a long enough gap (the equivalent of waking), a detached worker runs a
// full consolidation — including the LLM session-noise clearing that turns the
// day's narration-vs-narration contradictions back into quiet. Dissonance then
// follows a circadian rhythm — up through a working day, down overnight —
// instead of a one-way ratchet. Hosted brains are skipped and consolidate on
// their own server-side cron.

// sleepInterval is the minimum gap between automatic consolidations. Just under
// a day so a next-morning session reliably triggers it, and cheap-to-skip
// otherwise: the day's noise is what accrues over hours, not minutes.
