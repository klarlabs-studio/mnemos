# ADR 0019: Brain health — vital signs, integrity checks, and health-over-time

- **Status:** Accepted; implemented (v0.97.0).
- **Date:** 2026-07-13
- **Deciders:** Felix Geelhaar
- **Scope:** Diagnostics / observability. Answers "is the brain *healthy* right now, and
  is its health trending the right way?" — which nothing before this could.

## Context

Mnemos has liveness checks (`/health`, `/internal/ready`, `doctor` — DB/LLM/embedding
reachability + version) and it has many **cognitive vital signs**, but they are
**scattered**: calibration, predictive-error/free-energy, hypercorrections (dissonance),
knowledge gaps, and trust counts each live behind a *separate* command or endpoint, with
**no rollup, no thresholds, and no single verdict**. Three things are missing entirely:

1. **A unified health verdict.** Nothing aggregates the vitals into "healthy / degraded /
   unhealthy" with thresholds, so an operator (or the hosted products) cannot ask one
   question and get one answer.
2. **Structural-integrity / pathology detection.** There is no check for orphan claims
   (beliefs with zero evidence), dangling relationships (edges to missing claims), or a
   backlog of overdue unresolved predictions. A brain can be *corrupt* and nothing notices.
3. **Health over time.** Vitals are strictly point-in-time; there is no log of the brain's
   vital signs on a health cadence (free-energy is only incidentally captured inside
   `--journal` consolidation passes).

(Also: `quality`'s `stale_count` is a dead value — never incremented — so the unused
`CheckSLOs` divides by a structural zero. Fixed here in passing.)

## Decision

Add a single read-only **brain-health** surface that rolls the scattered vitals plus new
integrity checks into one verdict, and that can snapshot itself to the cognitive journal
so health becomes a **queryable time series**.

### `Memory.BrainHealth` — one verdict

`BrainHealth{ Status, Vitals[], Pathologies[], At }` where `Status` is
`healthy | degraded | unhealthy` (the worst of all component statuses). Strictly
read-only.

**Vitals** (each a value + its own OK/WARN/CRIT threshold; the impl knows each one's
direction). v1 set, reusing existing producers:

- **free_energy** — `PredictiveError().Total` (the overall prediction-error aggregate).
- **calibration** — `Calibration().ECE`.
- **dissonance** — active hypercorrections per belief (`Hypercorrections`).
- **low_trust** — fraction of currently-valid beliefs below a trust floor.
- **staleness** — fraction of currently-valid beliefs not verified within a staleness
  horizon (a documented recency proxy for freshness decay).

**Pathologies** (integrity checks that did not exist before — counts, escalating with
severity):

- **orphan_claims** — currently-valid beliefs with **zero evidence** (a claim requires
  evidence; an orphan is a data-integrity smell).
- **dangling_edges** — relationships whose endpoint claim **does not exist** (referential
  corruption — CRIT).
- **stale_expectations** — **open** expectations whose horizon is **past** (a backlog of
  predictions the brain never reconciled — its prediction loop is stalling).

### `mnemos health` — the surface

`mnemos health [--human] [--journal]`. Default: the current verdict (JSON, or a readable
table with `--human`). `--journal`: also append a **`health`** entry (a new journal kind,
reusing the ADR-0018 `cognitive_journal`) — so running it on a cadence (cron, or after
each consolidation) builds a **health-over-time series** with no new table. Read the
series with `mnemos journal --kind health`.

## Consequences

- **Positive.** One question, one answer: is the brain healthy? Adds the pathology
  detection that was entirely absent (a corrupt brain is now visible). Reuses the journal
  so health-over-time is free and plots alongside free-energy. The hosted products get a
  real cognitive health check, not just a liveness ping.
- **Cost / guardrails.** Read-only; **no new table** (health snapshots reuse the ADR-0018
  journal). A full-scan diagnostic (lists claims/evidence/relationships once) — meant to
  be run on demand or on a modest cadence, not per request. Thresholds are conservative
  defaults, documented; tuning them against real data is exactly what the journal (ADR
  0018) now enables.
- **Negative / scope limits (v1).** The staleness vital is a recency proxy, not the full
  liveness model; the vital set is curated, not exhaustive (schema-health, embedding
  coverage deferred); thresholds are fixed constants (not yet config-driven).

## Rollout

Shipped in v0.97.0: `Memory.BrainHealth`, `mnemos health` (+`--human`, `--journal`), the
five vitals, the three integrity checks, the new `health` journal kind + `journal --kind`
filter, and the `stale_count` fix — with tests over a healthy brain, each pathology, and
the health-snapshot round-trip. Threshold tuning rides on ADR 0018's journal.

## Amendments

### `unknown` — a vital with no data behind it (v0.122.0)

A sixth status, `unknown`, distinguishes "measured and fine" from "never measured".
Calibration reported an ECE of 0.0000 over **zero** adjudicated beliefs and rendered
green. `unknown` does **not** roll up into the overall verdict — absence of evidence of
a problem is not evidence of one — so a fresh brain is not degraded on day one. Also
added `skill_coverage`: every other vital is computed over *claims*, so a brain with
86,505 beliefs and zero actions/outcomes/lessons showed five green vitals.

### `trust_decay` — the rate, not the level (this change)

The v1 set reported trust as two point-in-time **levels**: `low_trust` (already below the
floor) and `staleness` (missed a fixed 90-day horizon). Neither answers *is trust
falling, and how fast* — and neither reads the decay model the brain actually carries.
`domain.Claim.HalfLifeDays` is stamped at ingest by the volatility classifier and honoured
by query staleness, curiosity and float-back, but it was **monitored nowhere**: a brain
could be shedding its volatile beliefs on a fortnightly half-life with every vital green.

- **What it measures.** The share of **currently-trusted** beliefs whose trust falls
  through the same floor `low_trust` uses (0.30) within **30 days** if nothing
  re-verifies them. The leading indicator to `low_trust`'s lagging one; directly
  actionable, since it names a month of re-verification work in advance.
- **How.** The real decay model (`trust.ScoreWithHalfLife`) evaluated at two instants
  over real stored data — each belief at **its own** half-life. No sampling, no estimate.
  Deliberately conservative in two places, both under-reporting decay: the freshness
  reference is the belief's `ValidFrom`/`LastVerified` (never newer than its freshest
  evidence, which the scan does not load), and the evidence count is ungraded for
  independence (which can only overstate corroboration).
- **Why a crossing rate, not aggregate trust lost per unit time.** The aggregate is
  perverse: exponential decay is steepest right *after* evidence arrives, so a brain
  being actively fed would score worst, and one whose every belief had already bottomed
  out on the freshness floor would score a clean zero.
- **`unknown` when no belief is above the floor** — an empty brain and a fully-decayed
  one both have no trust left to lose, and a green 0 for the second is exactly the
  failure the `unknown` status exists to prevent. `low_trust` owns that state.
- **Thresholds are derived, not chosen.** `warn = low_trust_warn / 3`,
  `crit = low_trust_crit / 3`: the outflow that, sustained over a quarter (three
  horizons), carries a fully-trusted brain to `low_trust`'s own warn/crit line
  unaided. Re-tuning the floor's thresholds re-tunes the rate that fills it, rather than
  leaving two constants to drift apart. (Approximate — it ignores the compounding as the
  trusted base shrinks, which errs toward warning early.)
- **Known limit.** The *persisted* `trust_score` is still recomputed with the **global**
  half-life (`pipeline.defaultTrustScorer` and `Consolidate` both call `trust.Score`), so
  it cannot see a volatile belief. The vital therefore reads the model rather than the
  stored column; both its endpoints come from the same evaluation, so the comparison is
  internally consistent. Making the persisted score honour `HalfLifeDays` is a separate,
  larger change (it moves everything that ranks on trust).

Same change: `low_trust` and `staleness` now grade with their sample count — 0/0 valid
beliefs is `unknown`, not healthy — and `--human` renders `unknown` as `[ ?? ]` instead
of falling through to `[ ok ]`, which had been undoing the v0.122.0 fix for every reader
who did not pipe the output through `jq`.

### One population for every rate; `free_energy` and `dissonance` can be `unknown` (2026-10-04, #389)

The `unknown` amendment above was applied to `calibration`, `low_trust` and
`staleness` but not to the two vitals derived from `PredictiveError`:

- **dissonance** divided live hypercorrections by `Claims.CountAll`, which
  counts every row ever stored. Its numerator already ignores retired beliefs,
  so each forgotten, deprecated or pruned belief diluted the rate. A brain
  that retired half its beliefs reported half the dissonance with the same live
  contradictions. The denominator is now the live population (`isLiveBelief`:
  valid time open and not deprecated). That is the same population the
  low-trust, staleness and trust-decay rates use. With no live beliefs the
  vital is `unknown`.
- **free_energy** was graded even when no level had data. Its total is then
  0.0, the best possible value, so an empty brain scored as healthy on the axis
  that summarises the others. `PredictiveError.LevelsMeasured` now records how
  many levels contributed, and the vital is `unknown` when it is 0.
  `unknown` ranks below `ok`, so an empty brain's overall verdict is unchanged.

Still open under #389: `low_trust` reads stored trust while `trust_decay`
reads the per-belief model (#386), calibration's population, and versioning
health snapshots.
